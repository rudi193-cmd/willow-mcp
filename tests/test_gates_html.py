"""Tests for gates_html.py — the shared page shell/CSS/JS between the
static gates snapshot and the live dashboard.

Mostly structural: the two callers (gates_panel.render_html,
gates_serve._render_page) already have their own tests exercising the
assembled output end to end; this file pins the few things that would
silently break both of them at once if this shared module regressed.
