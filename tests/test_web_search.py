# `trusted_only=True` is a parameter on the `willow_web_search` MCP tool, so
# this label is handed to a model as a reason to believe a page. It was:
#
#   * spoofable — `host.endswith(suffix)` had no notion of a label boundary, so
#     any registrable domain ending in a trusted string inherited its trust.
#     `evilnature.com`, `notarxiv.org`, `myjstor.org`, `evildp.la` all passed,
#     and every one of those is an open registration anyone can buy.
#   * broken for two of its own entries — `.lstrip("www.")` strips leading
#     *characters* from {w, .}, not the prefix, so `wikipedia.org` became
#     `ikipedia.org` and `wikidata.org` became `ikidata.org`.
#
# The two bugs partly masked each other: `web.archive.org` was mangled to
# `eb.archive.org` and then rescued by the loose `endswith`.
